# File Modification Policy

## README.md Protection

**IMPORTANT**: Do not automatically modify, update, or reformat `README.md` unless the user explicitly requests changes to the README file.

### Rules for README.md:
- Only modify README.md when the user specifically asks to update documentation
- Do not apply automatic formatting or corrections to README.md
- Do not add or remove content from README.md as part of other tasks
- If you need to suggest README changes, ask the user first instead of making the changes

### Exceptions:
- User explicitly says "update the README" or similar
- User asks to "document" something and specifically mentions the README
- User requests changes to project documentation

### Other Documentation Files:
- This policy applies specifically to README.md
- Other documentation files can be updated as needed for technical accuracy
- Code comments and inline documentation are not restricted by this policy

## Rationale

The README.md file serves as the primary project documentation and should remain stable unless intentionally updated. Automatic modifications can disrupt the intended messaging and structure of the project documentation.
